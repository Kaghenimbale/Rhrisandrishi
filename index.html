        <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2> <br>
        <ul>
          <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li><br>
          <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks <br> to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li> <br>
          <li>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br> Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li> <br>
          <li>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li> <br>
          <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <br> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br> Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li> <br>
          <li>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br> to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li> <br>
          <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li> <br>
          <li>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. <br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease <br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li> <br>
          <li>1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat <br> yields
          </li> <br>
        </ul>
